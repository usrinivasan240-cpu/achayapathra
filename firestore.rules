/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Achayapathra application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and public-read/owner-write access patterns.
 * User data is strictly controlled by the owning user.
 * Donations are publicly readable but writable only by the donor.
 * Volunteer tasks, feedback, leaderboard data, and site stats have restricted access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user identified by {userId}.
 * - /donations/{donationId}: Stores donation information. Publicly readable, but only the donor can create, update, or delete.
 * - /volunteerTasks/{volunteerTaskId}: Stores volunteer task information. Only the associated volunteer or owner of the parent donation can create, update, or delete.
 * - /feedbacks/{feedbackId}: Stores feedback data. Only the user who created feedback can modify it.
 * - /leaderboard/{leaderboardId}: Stores leaderboard data. Write access is denied for now, read access is public.
 * - /siteStats/{siteStatsId}: Stores site statistics. Write access is denied for now, read access is public.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /donations collection, enabling wide visibility of available donations.
 * - Write access to Leaderboard and SiteStats collections is explicitly denied in this prototype phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `donations` collection includes the `donorId` field to enable owner-only write access without requiring additional reads.
 * - The `volunteerTasks` collection includes `donationId` and `volunteerId` to enable rules based on the associated donation and volunteer.
